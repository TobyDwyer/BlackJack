## Introduction
This is my first attempt at properly developing my own game. The aim of this project is to build a basic single player blackjack game.
I chose this as my first game as I feel like I have a good understanding of blackjack and developing a card game has always been an interest of mine.
I have hopes of taking this game further and opening it up to local multiplayer as well as creating better UI design. A long way in the future is to create 
a player leaderboard and allow for online play as well as possible web hosting for the app.
